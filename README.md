# Risky-Racer
A small mobile game to demonstrate and practice different features that are key to mobile development.
Created in Unity with C# for Mobile (Tested on Android).

Summary:
I created this mobile app with the intention of learning how to develop for mobile as I didn't have the opportunity to learn this area while completing my degree at University. This is the first project I have built after completing my degree. I learnt most of the basics from a Udemy course and then expanded and transformed the game, adding many more features into what it has become now.

Features:
- Advertisements
- In App purchases
- Car selection/Customisation
- Track Selection
- Dynamic track obstacles (trucks moving)
- Coin collection system
- Highscore system (individual for each track)
- Energy system
- Notifications and timer for energy recharge
- Background music/SFX and visual effects
